<h3>Richard Vale</h3>
<p>
 I am currently (2015) working outside academia. In 2014 I was a Lecturer in the Statistics Department at the University of Canterbury. 
 I have a PhD in mathematics from the University of Glasgow (2007) and was an HC Wang Assistant Professor at Cornell University.
 Previously I studied at the University of Auckland and the University of Cambridge (Part III Mathematics, aka M.A.St 2003). 
 I have also taught at Oberlin College, the University of Auckland, and AUT.

<h4>Research</h4>
I am planning to attend the <a href="https://secure.orsnz.org.nz/conf48/">joint NZSA/ORSNZ conference</a> in November and to present  a  discussion of a
 network imputation problem at the <a href="https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~mcw/workshop2014/">CMSS summer worskop</a> on December 9-10 2014.
<br><br>
I have recently been working on Bayesian modelling of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire">
<i>Game of Thrones</i></a> and some results, including a paper and code, can be found <a
 href="bayesofthrones.html">here</a>. Here is a link to the <a href="got_290814.pdf">paper (pdf)</a> which contains spoilers for all five of the books
(if you haven't read them, click with caution.)
<br><br>
This work has attracted some media attention and was featured in the <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2014/09/26/statistician-applies-predictive-modeling-to-game-of-thrones/">Wall Street Journal</a> and 
<a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/10/game-of-thrones-4/">Wired</a> among others. I also wrote an article about it for the 
<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/richard-vale/can-statistics-predict-ga_b_5956590.html">Huffington Post</a>. Here are the 
<a href="http://www.math.canterbury.ac.nz/~r.vale/rv_81014.pdf">slides (pdf)</a> from a public lecture I gave about it. There is also a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dGBjjWaGTw&index=1&list=PL1D0DE06F56864BA4">
Youtube video</a> from the lecture.
<br><br>
I have also recently been working with <a href="https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/showperson?firstname=Rachel&surname=Fewster">Rachel Fewster</a> on capture-recpature models with applications to whales.
Our paper:

misidentification. Biometrics, in press, 2014. <a href="https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~fewster/Vale_et_al_Mtalpha.pdf">Full text (PDF)</a>
 and <a href="https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~fewster/Vale_et_al_Mtalpha_Web_Appendix.pdf">Web Appendix.</a> Also <a href="Mta.pdf", target="new">slides</a> from a talk I gave at CREEM, St. Andrews in July 2014.
<br><br>
In Febraury 2014 I gave a seminar at <a href="http://www.mbie.govt.nz/">The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment</a> on copula methods and interactive statistical graphics using Javascript and Canvas.
